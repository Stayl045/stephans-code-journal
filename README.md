this is my journal entry

- Ugh, attempted three times to create a repository before finally getting it right!
- Finally have settled on a repo that works for me.
- Had to research some html basics to create an unordered list.
- Taking a break until tomorrow afternoon to complete this assignment.

## January 12th 2022
Last night I didn't feel comfortbale with completing this assignment early due to some uncertainty. However, today with Tony's excellent teaching, I am more comfortable with what I am doing.
- I was confused as I originally thought I had to write these journals in HTML as I copied the steps on Tony's cheatsheet. Now that I am doing this on MD, I am hopefully less confused. 
- Next step...pushing. Hope nothing breaks!
