this is my journal entry

## January 11th 2022

- Ugh, attempted three times to create a repository before finally getting it right!
- Finally have settled on a repo that works for me.
- Had to research some html basics to create an unordered list.
- Taking a break until tomorrow afternoon to complete this assignment.

## January 12th 2022

Last night I didn't feel comfortbale with completing this assignment early due to some uncertainty. However, today with Tony's excellent teaching, I am more comfortable with what I am doing.

- I was confused as I originally thought I had to write these journals in HTML as I copied the steps on Tony's cheatsheet. Now that I am doing this on MD, I am hopefully less confused.
- Next step...pushing. Hope nothing breaks!
- Ran into issues with https. **Thankfully, worked with Tony and the class to set up an SSH key. It took some work, but we finally got it and I was finally able to push the repo.**

## January 17-18th 2022 Code Journal 1

Goal: Push 1st README.md to GitHub without online help for Assessment #1. My ultimate goal for now is to make this process second nature in use!…here I go. SCARY!

**Steps:**

1. Create a file in my root directory.
2. Create a README.md file in that directory.
3. Add relevant information to my assessment.
4. Follow instructions laid out for this assignment.
5. Use `git init` command without any hassle.
6. Create a blank repo on “GitHub”.
7. Don’t check create initialize contents such as “README.md".
8. Click“Create” repository.

Plans failed…

I was really nervous when attempting to push my Journal to GitHub having some issues. I therefore broke down and used your help.

New plan (Taken from the help page):

1. Follow the steps provided on the website.
2. I was successfully able to push to my repo.
3. I will finish the rest tomorrow.

**January 18th**
Plan: to finished assignment #1: UX breakdown by the end of the day.

- First, I must learn some of the basics of Figma.
- I feel like I am learning the basic tools such as:
  - toying with my frames to look like cellphones.
  - creating some space between each frame so it's more pleasing to the eye.
  - utilized soft colour pallette so it's easy to read and follow.
  - tried to play with Prototype, but quickly called that quits.
- All in all, I ,ade a good outline for the assignment if I don't say so myself.
- I had some trouble adding icons such as “Search Icon”. I think I have to attribute then and components to my figma.
- I gave up and didn’t bother searching for outside icons, so I hand drew the icons (which took some time).
- Had fun figuring out figma and successfully created a wireflow without much of an issue.
  - Initially I struggled to figureout how to add images to MD to push to Git hub. However this link helped:
    - [MD Help](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- I successfully completed my plan and finished my assignment #1 of design with the help of the website to add my wireframe.

## January 20th **CPNT-Code-Journal #1**

No plan for today really… Just trying to absorb everything that Ash taught. A lot of different codes to memorize, page layout, and overall structuring. I think I will get there if I keep practicing the content.

**Some key notes that Ash said:**

- `CMD-shift-C`to open up Developer Tools.
- `CMD-OPT-I` to highlight in the browser to specific codes.

Another cool piece of advice that Ash gave is to, “Throw some concepts together one your down time to keep yourself fresh”. I will try to keep this in mind going forward just in case.

**Other things to keep in mind:**

- `Article`: Stand-alone. This is a good way of knowing where to place the`Article` attribute.
- Section: Larger content.
- Shortcuts to create a list: `<li> Li*3`.

**Future Goals:**

- Experiment with CSS styling more. For example, learn how to add differet images in a box and organize them that is pleasing to look at.
- memorize the layout of HTML, its codes, and how they interact with CSS.
- Play around more with CodePen on some spare time of mine.
- if i'm feeling bold. Maybe trying add some JS into my codepens.

**Proof of Work**
![WikiArticle](https://github.com/Stayl045/stephans-code-journal/blob/a0ec5ce54949528f6ebf058023d5d1770ed75cb9/Proof%20of%20Work.png)

**Links that I looked to when using CSS**
[CSSColour](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)

- I used this tool in the past and I remembred that I could've used it for this first assignment.

## **January 21st**

**Issue**

- Live Page isnt working.
  ![Screencap](https://github.com/Stayl045/stephans-code-journal/blob/13d505da8bd188cfca2d8bbdb9e80573c3920bb0/Broken%20Live.png)
  **Resolved**
  - Simply had to go into the extention and it asked me to reload the extention. This seemed to have fixed the issue.
  - Need to attibute the "lord of the rings" image.
    **Issue**
- Tried to change Live Server to FireFox, but it didn't work.

Ash gave us a quick rundown on how to push code through terminal, so I have a new plan:

**Plan:**

- Learn how create files and folders through the terminal rather then the GUI way.

  - In the terminal at the root `mkdir assets` for example to create a directoy.
  - `touch` to create a file.
  - `mv` to move a file.
  - `rm` to remove a file.
  - `../` go back one directory.
  - `./` right here.

- Ash also gave great adivce that will help me going forward. Use "open to the side" in VS to have my "code journal" on the side, so that I can add entries on the fly.

- My brother provided key shorts cuts
  - `Option + shift + down` to create a quick copy.

**January 24th 2022**

- ## GOAL
  - Create a responsive Nav Bar.
  - Has to be responsive.
  - That its pleasing to look at.
  - Create a responsive button.
- ## NOTES FROM CLASS
  - `:root {}`
    - Sets custom colours.
    - `flex-grow` selects certain items to take up more space.
    - `flex-wrap` shrink.containers to be stack down as window gets smaller.
    - `Overflow-wrap`
    - To inspect colours on a webpage on FireFox, click the little dropper to the right on DevTools.

Future **goal**: To create a drop down menu on my nav bar when making window smaller.

## January 25th, 2022

**Goals**

- Make a responsive hamburger menu.
- optomixe the text FlexBox.
- Improve overall design.
- Change branch from `master` to `main`.
- Adjust header text size and font styling.
- inquire if images saved on local will show up when someone opens up my repo?
- Make my MGS page life on Pages.
- Maybe fix my body margin.
- add some more effects to the cards
  - Background shadow/glow
  - Play with more transition and hover effects.
- **IMPORTANT**: Make hover on
  cards clickable.
- Maybe add a `transform: Rotate`.
- Add `box-shadow` effect.
- Play around more with `Utility Classes` as it was a topic of discussion for most of the day.

## Notes from Class

- Make all your assignments **MIT License.**
- At top of CSS add:
  - body { margin: 0; }
  - img {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    }
- use flex-gap between major components.
- `@media quiris` must always be at the bottom as they override.
  - Ash, said, "Queries get you to think what information is most important and which to cut". This is based on the screen size.
  - Make changes specifically on the query based on which they way you want it to look on browser or mobile.

## Issue

- On GitHub, my CSS for my About Page isn't apprearing.
  ## **Fixed**
  - on the `link`, in the `HREF` I added a `.` before linking to the css.
- Images saved on local aren't showing up on GitHub.
