this is my journal entry 

## January 11th 2022 
- Ugh, attempted three times to create a repository before finally getting it right!
- Finally have settled on a repo that works for me.
- Had to research some html basics to create an unordered list.
- Taking a break until tomorrow afternoon to complete this assignment.

## January 12th 2022
Last night I didn't feel comfortbale with completing this assignment early due to some uncertainty. However, today with Tony's excellent teaching, I am more comfortable with what I am doing.
- I was confused as I originally thought I had to write these journals in HTML as I copied the steps on Tony's cheatsheet. Now that I am doing this on MD, I am hopefully less confused. 
- Next step...pushing. Hope nothing breaks!
- Ran into issues with https. **Thankfully, worked with Tony and the class to set up an SSH key. It took some work, but we finally got it and I was finally able to push the repo.**

## January 17-18th 2022 Code Journal 1

Goal: Push 1st README.md to GitHub without online help for Assessment #1. My ultimate goal for now is to make this process second nature in use!…here I go. SCARY!

**Steps:**
1. Create a file in my root directory.
2. Create a README.md file in that directory.
3. Add relevant information to my assessment.
4. Follow instructions laid out for this assignment.
5. Use `git init` command without any hassle.
6. Create a blank repo on “GitHub”.
7. Don’t check create initialize contents such as “README.md"/
8. Click“Create” repository. 

Plans failed…

I was really nervous when attempting to push my Journal to GitHub having some issues. I therefore broke down and used your help.

New plan (Taken from the help page):

Forgot that I should’ve used `$ git add .` and then git commit -p “Initial Commit” before pushing.
Once in “GitHub” Repo, copy “SSH key”
On terminal root directory, utilize `$ git push “”.
